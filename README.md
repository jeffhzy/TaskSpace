# Motivation
Often times, it is difficult to find motivation to study for that upcoming test or that assignment you have been procrastinating on. As the deadlines loom nearer, your bed looks more and more enticing. At times like this, it would be nice to have that extra motivation to spur you on or  someone to hold you accountable for the work you should have been doing. 

With the current pandemic, many have also found it difficult to make friends in school. With the majority of NUS students not living on campus, finding someone in the same course or taking the same module as you is often challenging, especially with online classes being the norm in recent times. Thus, many have difficulty finding shared resources such as notes from people taking the same modules as them.

# Aim
We hope to create a website platform where students can find others in the same course or with the same modules, share learning resources and motivate each other to complete their assignment tasks.

User Stories
1. As a student with a list of assignments to complete, I want to be able to share my to-do goals with others for peer accountability.
2. As a student looking for resources to help with studying, I want to be able to access shared resources with my peers.
3. As a student in a pandemic where it is difficult to find friends, I want to be able to find friends within the same course or taking the same modules.
4. As a student who wants to manage my time better, I want to keep records of my time spent studying.

# Scope of Project

TaskSpace website provides an all-in-one study companion, allowing students to keep track of their time spent studying as well as craft a to-do list that can be monitored by their peers. The website also employs a level system, where experience points can be earned by studying a certain amount of time(e.g each hour studied will gain the users 100 experience).

Users can also find friends through the search bar, or make new friends by entering common modules taken. 

Outlined below is a more elaborate explanation of the features we aim to accomplish with TaskSpace.

# Features

## Timer

A prominent timer will be displayed on the landing page. Users can start the timer whenever they are studying and stop the timer when they go for a break. Users can also choose to end their study session by pressing the ‘Log Session’ button, and the number of experience points accumulated from the time spent studying will be recorded and added to their total experience points.

Users can also choose the task they are currently working on from the list of tasks on their to-do list. When a task is selected and the user presses the “Log Session” button, the time spent on the task will be recorded and displayed on the task in the to-do list.

## To-do list
Users can create a daily/weekly to-do list that will be displayed on the front page. Users can create a new task by pressing the “Add New Task” button.

Upon pressing the “Add Task” button, the task will be added to the to-do list. Upon completion of the task, users can check the checkbox at the side of the task to signify its completion.  Users can filter tasks on the to-do list by their due date or its completion status. Users can also choose to edit or delete the task by pressing the respective options from the dropdown menu. Time spent for each task will also be displayed on the task.

## Level System
Users can accumulate experience points based on the amount of time spent studying. Once a threshold of experience points has been reached, the user will level up.       
Users can see the leaderboards, where they can toggle between seeing the friends leaderboard or the leaderboard for all students. The leaderboard will display the top students with the highest experience points. Clicking on the names of the users from the leaderboard will direct them to their profile page.

## Searchbar
Users will be able to look up other users by typing in their name, major or the year they are in. Clicking on the result will direct them to the user’s profile page.

Users will also be able to look up notes posted by themselves or other users by typing in the module code the note is associated with, or the title of the note. Clicking on the result will direct them to the respective page for the notes.

## Notes
Users will be able to upload their own notes with relevant tags such as module name, title and description.

Users can ‘like’ notes that they find helpful, and the number of people who have ‘liked’ that note will be displayed. Users can also download the note by pressing on the “View” button.

## Friends
Users can also add friends they found through the search bar. By going to their profile page, they can select the add friends button. A request will then show up on the other user’s friends page.

Upon accepting the friend request, the new friend will now appear in the friends page. Clicking on the bar will direct the user to their friend’s profile page.

## Login Page
Users can login to their accounts if they have already created one. Information needed at login includes email and password.

Users can also opt to sign up for an account if they do not have one. Information needed at sign up includes name, email, password, major and year of study.

## Profile page
Each user will have their own profile page, which can be accessed by others. The profile page will include their name, year, major, level as well as their own to-do list. When viewing other profiles(not their own), users can choose to send a friend request by clicking on the “Send Friend Request” button. Users will also have the freedom to choose their own profile picture and cover picture to be displayed on their profile page.

## Account Page
In the account page, users will be able to select a profile picture and a cover picture from images saved on their computer. Upon choosing an image, the user can press “Upload” to save the picture as their profile/cover picture.
